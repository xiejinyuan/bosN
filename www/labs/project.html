<h1><a class="aos" href="..">CS240h</a> Final project</h1>

<p>
The final lab assignment for the class is to undertake a mini research
project of your choice involving Haskell in a group of 1-3 people.  At
the end of the term, in addition to the code, you will turn in a short
(4-8 page) paper describing your project.  You will also present your
and demo your results in a mini-conference held during the class's
final exam period, Thursday, December 15 12:15pm-3:15pm.  Lunch will
be provided.  Make sure you can attend this final exam, as your
group's presentation will be an important part of your final grade.
</p>

<p>
If your project overlaps with your research, this is not a problem.
We actually encourage this.  However, if your final project overlaps
with a project for another class (including an independent study you
are taking for credit), you must obtain permission from the instructor
of the other class in an email CCed to the CS240h staff mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Any of the papers or techniques we discuss in class can be used as a
inspiration for a project.  Here are a few more specific ideas.  This
list will gradually expand as the course staff thinks of more
suggestions.  You are by no means limited to the list.
</p>

<ul class="spaced">

<li>
Implement a system that safely incorporates untrusted code through the
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/SafeHaskell">SafeHaskell</a>
extension.  There are several possibilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    You could implement "Haskell@Home"--a generalized version of
    services such
    as <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@home</a> and
    <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You could implement a 'bot that executes untrusted code along the
    lines of
    <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot">Lambdabot</a>.
    Lambdabot was written before Haskell was typesafe, and as a result
    is fairly hairy code and very limited in functionality.  Using
    type safety you ought to be able to achieve something much cleaner
    and simpler, and that provides far more functionality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement some sort of end-user programmable web-site (like
    Wikipedia, but for code rather than for information).
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement an online Haskell REPL environment such a
    <a href="http://tryhaskell.org">Try Haskll</a>.  Using Safe Haskell
    and some of the recent support in GHC 7.3 for data declarations in GHCi
    you should be able to provide a far more powerful feature set then
    existing websites.
  </li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>
  Implement a parser library with a parsec-inspired interface, but
  that generates DFA-based parsers.
</li>

<li>
  Add garbage collection for dynamically-loaded code to GHC.
</li>

<li>
  Implement any of the popular Google programming abstractions
  (Chubby, Map-reduce, BigTable) or related ideas (such
  as <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Murray.pdf">Ciel</a>
  or <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Bolosky.pdf">Paxos-based
  data storage</a>) in Haskell.
</li>

<li>
  Develop a new generic programming or automatic-instance-generating
  system for Haskell, possibly using template Haskell or
  haskell-src-exts.  This has been done before, but it is not hard to
  identify shortcomings of previous approaches that your
  implementation could remedy.
</li>

<li>
  Develop an extension to the Haskell language that increases
  expressiveness.  (For instance, the simple ability to require the
  inequality of two type parameters in class instance declarations
  would allow all kinds programming techniques that today require the
  frowned-upon OverlappingInstances extension.)
</li>

<li>
  Develop a high-level database interface for Haskell.
  <a href="http://trac.haskell.org/haskelldb">HaskellDB</a> is one
  example of an interesting way to leverage Haskell's type system to
  make type-safe SQL queries, but it's a bit hairy.  Can you do
  something simpler for a no-SQL database?  Or build a
  higher-layer <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">RAILS</a>-like
  object-relational mapping for Haskell?
</li>

<li>
Implement RAMCloud bindings for Haskell and build an application in
Haskell that takes advantage of RAMCloud's unique performance
characteristics.
</li>

<li>
Integrate Haskell into a web browser.  There are several options for
this:
<ul>
<li>
Implement a GHC back-end for Google's
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Native Client</a>
environment.
</li>
<li>
Develop PPAPI (pepper plugin-api) bindings for Haskell.
</li>
<li>
Use <a href="https://github.com/sviperll/ghcjs">ghcjs</a> to compile
Haskell directly to Javascript.  Develop a library that shows off
Haskell's flexibility for programming styles--for instance by
supporting functional reactive programming along the lines of that
provided by
<a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
  Put Haskell into an operating system kernel, and use it to allow
  untrusted extensions
  (like <a href="http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu/">SPIN</a>) or
  untrusted device drivers.
</li>

<li>
  Develop a Monad with an IO-like interface, but that logs all IO
  actions (such as changes to memory or the file system) in such a way
  that they can be undone.  Hence, the execution of a program built on
  this interface can be reversed for debugging or failure recovery
  purposes.
</li>

<li>
  Add vector / SIMD support to GHC. This is a very heavily requested feature
  of GHC and is something that is really needed by the community given a lot of
  emphasis on parallel programming in Haskell. Here are some links to info about
  this:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/VectorComputing">
     GHC Wiki: Vector Computing</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/SIMD">
     GHC Wiki: SIMD Computing</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3557">
     GHC Ticket 3557: Add vector opps</a></li>
  </ul>
  The basics of this task shouldn't be that hard, especially if you only worry
  about supporting GHC's LLVM backend. Providing a nice API to the user though
  and then porting packages like <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa">
  repa</a> would make this a nice project.
</li>

</ul>
