<h1 class="title">CS240H Lab 1</h1>
<h1 id="word-frequency-histogram">Word frequency histogram</h1>
<p>Write a standalone program that will display (using ASCII art) a histogram of word frequencies from one or more text files (or from <code>stdin</code>).</p>
<p>Your program should be insensitive to case, so it should consider &quot;FOO&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; as &quot;the same&quot;.</p>
<p>You should submit your work in the form of a URL to a publicly accessible <code>git</code> repository, which should include the source and a <code>README</code> file that tells us:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Who you are.</p></li>
<li><p>How to build and run your program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will award monetary bonuses in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatloo">Quatloos</a>, the currency of the planet Triskelion, to those who achieve one or more of the following accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If we can build your project using the standard <code>cabal</code> build tool.</p></li>
<li><p>We find your source code to be structured and commented in such a way that someone other than you can quickly figure out what is going on.</p></li>
<li><p>We run the <code>hlint</code> tool over your source code and it reports nothing that raises our eyebrows.</p></li>
<li><p>You submit a program that we can measure as performing awesomely on a (respectably large) data set of our choosing. Criteria for awesomeness will include such things as performance and memory footprint.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The winner of the most quatloos gets a special edition JPEG of a pony.</p>
